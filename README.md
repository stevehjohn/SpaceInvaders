# Space Invaders Challenge

Over beer on the weekend, a friend asked me how long he thought it would take to code Space Invaders. I estimated around 2 hours. I'm on holiday from work this week so I thought I'd find out.

I am an experienced coder, so don't criticise all the rules I break regarding best practices in this, it was simply a race for fun.
